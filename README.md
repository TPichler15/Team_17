# Login Sesame - Yet another FOSS Password Manager

**Login Sesame** is meant to be a Free and Open Source password manager for **Android**.

<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/ydrZsWh9/login-sesame-icon.png" width="150">

Among its main features, we should implement:
  
  * User friendly UI
  * Locally stored, ecrypted password vault
  * Secure, random password generator with different features
  * Secure notes area
  * Biometric app login (e.g. with fingerprint sensor if available)
  * Easy copy user/password to clipboard
  * ...

## Long term vision
After the Android application already has all the major features implemented, the long
term vision of the project is to develop a server application to which the Android app
would connect and the user could automatically sync the vault over multiple devices.
